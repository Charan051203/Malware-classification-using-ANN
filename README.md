Malware Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains the implementation of a project focused on classifying malware using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The project aims to accurately identify and categorize various types of malware by leveraging the capabilities of ANN models.

Key Features:

1. Dataset Preparation: Steps for preprocessing and preparing the malware dataset for training.
2. Model Development: Construction and training of an ANN model tailored for malware classification.
3. Model Evaluation: Assessment of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Results: Analysis of the classification outcomes and visualization of the model's performance.
   
How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Follow the provided python scripts to train the ANN model and evaluate its performance on the malware dataset (train_vec.csv).
   
This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Neural Networks in cybersecurity, specifically in detecting and classifying malware.
